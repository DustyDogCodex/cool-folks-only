Simple authentication app built using ReactJS, Express and Passport. 

For this app, I will be building a website that requires users to login in to access a dashboard. Users will need to register and create an account first. The user info will be encrypted using bcrypt and stored in a database. This will then be used to authenticate users when they try and log into the app to access the dashboard.
